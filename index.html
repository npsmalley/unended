      <h1>About our podcast</h1>
      <p>Have you ever watched a show that was cancelled prematurely?</p>
      <p>Been frustrated by unresolved story arcs?</p>
      <p>Invested in characters who never got the ending they deserved?</p>
      <p>Then this is the podcast for you!</p>
      <p>Join me and my ensemble of guests as we discuss the highs and lows of these could be classics, as well as exploring what might have been.</p>

      <h1>About the host</h1>
      <p>Ay-up! Well, what can I say about me?</p>
      <p>I'm a father, developer, gamer, actor, and now podcaster.</p>
      <p>
        I was born in the era of <i>Ghostbusters</i> and <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>;
        grew up in the era of <i>the X-Files</i> and <i>Round the Twist</i>;
        and live in an era where I can re-watch those classic TV shows, as well as other classics like <i>Doctor Who</i> and <i>I Love Lucy</i>.
        I was geek before it was chic, and proud of it!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm the ultimate telly addict, who drives my partner insane by shouting,
        'Oh look, it's Wanda Ventham! She's Benedict Cumberbatch's mother.'
        Only to get the 'I have no idea who that is' look in return.
      </p>
