    <p>Have you ever watched a show that was cancelled prematurely?<br>
      Been frustrated by unresolved story arcs?<br>
      Invested in characters who never got the ending they deserved?<br>
      Then this is the podcast for you!
    </p>
    <p>Unended explores the shows which never quite reached their full potential.<br>
      Join me and my ensemble of guests as we discuss the highs and lows of these could be classics, as well as exploring what might have been.
